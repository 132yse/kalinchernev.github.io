      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Kalin Chernev, and this website is probably my 5th place to blog, I stopped counting.
My track of experience is filled with projects on Drupal and sometimes a bit of WordPress,
but this time there&amp;rsquo;s no CMS behind this website. This website/blog is hosted on github pages for 2 main reasons: &lt;strong&gt;be close to code&lt;/strong&gt; from github, and &lt;strong&gt;keep things simple&lt;/strong&gt; hosting only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;rsquo;m working mostly with JavaScript in various forms. That&amp;rsquo;s why you will encounter the notes I&amp;rsquo;m taking
in this blog on my way of understanding concepts, trying frameworks, experimenting with libraries
and all sorts of tools solving problems with JavaScript. It&amp;rsquo;s just amazing how this language got so
versatile to solve so many types of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web has evolved so much in recent years, and the speed of evolution is accelerating greatly.
We solve more complex problems, which lead to even more sophisticated problems to solve.
Thus, this blog keeps things simple - it&amp;rsquo;s plain good old HTML, CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in experimentation and open source contribution as a way to learn and keep up
with the accelerated pace of change in Web. That&amp;rsquo;s what you can expect from this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Agile documentation for your API-driven project</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openapis.org/&#34;&gt;Open API standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Documentation is like sex; when it’s good, it’s very, very good, and when it’s bad, it’s better than nothing.” — Dick Brandon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this article is to inspire improved workflows for building and maintaining documentation for API-driven projects. In the end of the story, you will hopefully try out new approaches of documenting your code. As such, it automatically increases the value of your work through making it more maintainable and re-usable in less time and efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://swagger.io/&#34;&gt;Swagger&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular and widely adopted specifications for RESTful APIs. In fact, the specification got off so well that &lt;a href=&#34;http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/&#34;&gt;numerous community tools&lt;/a&gt; are available. Also, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openapis.org/&#34;&gt;Open API initiative&lt;/a&gt; was born as a result of successful projects that use these tools basing on this specification in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=swagger%20api&#34;&gt;raise of popularity&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, leading experts started sharing advice on as &lt;a href=&#34;https://scotch.io/tutorials/speed-up-your-restful-api-development-in-node-js-with-swagger&#34;&gt;speeding the development phase with Swagger&lt;/a&gt; and later making a &lt;a href=&#34;https://scotch.io/tutorials/document-your-already-existing-apis-with-swagger&#34;&gt;good documentation of an existing API&lt;/a&gt;, again same spec being involved. These are few examples of well-written tutorials demonstrating benefits of having an API and a good toolchain, and documentation around it. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://egghead.io/courses/build-node-js-apis-with-openapi-spec-swagger&#34;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and I think this trend will stay solid for the next couple of years. That’s because the Open API specification makes sense just enough to empower developers and business people to have a common language of how an interface should work. It is as a contract of communication and data format between humans and machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the Swagger specification brings several clear advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can &lt;a href=&#34;http://editor.swagger.io/#/&#34;&gt;write project specification&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; or 
&lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; formats. The &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; one is probably closer to humans, which is really nice.
(Yes, there are UI programs for that as well ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can &lt;a href=&#34;http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/&#34;&gt;generate server and client code automatically&lt;/a&gt;, because when the specification is solid, the tools are solid too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can also &lt;a href=&#34;http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/&#34;&gt;generate live documentation&lt;/a&gt; based on the same project specification. This is particularly useful and that’s why I’ll expand more on about this subject in this article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can program in many languages and the result of our work will stay alive longer, because it conforms to a server &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; client “contract”. Meaning, as long as you can make a swagger specification out of you work, you can move from one technology stack to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node.js is a popular choice for building the server part of applications, but it’s not the only one. The knowledge you can get from this article is transferable to almost any programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-makes-a-good-api-documentation&#34;&gt;What makes a good API documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s now expand on the subject of having an effective documentation. There are many ways to document your software (and API), still, there are few major points which you have to cover to make it right. There is a common denominator of what makes one documentation better than another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RV0AOyBUcpJ7vS1TuSx2ag.png&#34; alt=&#34;picture telling you to stop the documentation uglyness&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;auto-generation&#34;&gt;Auto-generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that is the most important one. Writing documentation should take the least amount of time and efforts, and should minimize the maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to find a good way to write the least amount of textual explanations for your API, which yields the highest value of practical guidelines for the user of the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;include-examples&#34;&gt;Include examples&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I speak from my personal experience here — it’s really pleasing when the documentation does not make me think too much. My advice: include some sample request objects, or some code samples, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consumer or a developer of the API, I want to have a quick-gratification access to something that I use and it just works directly. Rarely I want to open my &lt;a href=&#34;https://advancedrestclient.com/&#34;&gt;advanced REST client&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://curl.haxx.se/docs/&#34;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; while reading API documentation because it takes off my attention and is basically forcing me to get out of the page I’m reading in order to have “the real feeling” about how something works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;portable&#34;&gt;Portable&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a feature I consider equally important for an effective piece of documentation. This is when the auto-generated code can be either displayed as a page or an embedded window of information. It also means that the result of your documentation is re-usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a JavaScript developer reading this, you will know that how fascinating the number of possible view frameworks solutions are. One day we have to make a simple page with Bootstrap, then with React.js, Angular.js, Vue.js, etc. No matter the framework or the tool, integrating documentation in an app has to be as easy as an instantiation. (In order to keep the spirit of high productivity and low maintenance costs mentioned in one of the previous points)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;swagger-ui-comes-to-the-rescue&#34;&gt;Swagger UI comes to the rescue&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dt246jpThKkFh7TPUva-9A.png&#34; alt=&#34;image of the swagger ui taken as an example&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swagger UI is a widely-adopted solution to the problems above. The only drawback being that the markup generated by the tool is not &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbem.com/introduction/&#34;&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt;-ish or anything like this, thus preventing front-end developers to make really nice themes on top of the solution. (although it’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://meostrander.com/swagger-ui-themes/&#34;&gt;partially going on&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://petstore.swagger.io/#/&#34;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; (or the editor), you will notice that there are similarities in the information presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each endpoint of the API that is documented contains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short description (the textual explanation we usually over-do)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example samples of request bodies, options to change request types, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to try out the request &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; response operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, swagger-ui documentation is auto-generated based on a simple &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; swagger specification file. That is super-nice, because the specification that a business person writes or configures through an UI can serve as both a contract AND live documentation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-can-do-better-than-that&#34;&gt;We can do better than that&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! Even after following popular tools and tutorials, I felt there is room for improvement. Mainly — writing the documentation itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, the problem of writing a single specification file and then using tools to generate the documentation is easy until the maintenance comes into play. Imagine that the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yaml spec is maintained by the same developer or development team that is responsible for the API endpoints of the app server. Surely, there will be back and forth between the specification file and the code files that contain the actual implementation. It takes extra time and efforts to stay focused while jumping between editors and making sure that both resources are well-matched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the process of “specification &amp;gt; development &amp;gt; documentation &amp;gt; implementation” can improve. Namely, it is possible to do all them at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How? By writing swagger specification in the documentation blocks of our code and plugging watch tasks in-between! Yes, the specification might still be in ownership of another one, not the developer. But even then — what if can just see live documentation based on the comments we’re placing in our code? Wouldn’t it be a motivating factor to write better in-code documentation? What is more, wouldn’t it be easier for developers to maintain both the code and the documentation of endpoints where the two are just next to each other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the following piece of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34;&gt;/**
 * @swagger
 * /login:
 *   post:
 *     description: Login to the application
 *     produces:
 *       - application/json
 *     parameters:
 *       - name: username
 *         description: Username to use for login.
 *         in: formData
 *         required: true
 *         type: string
 *       - name: password
 *         description: User&#39;s password.
 *         in: formData
 *         required: true
 *         type: string
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: login
 */
app.post(&#39;/login&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  ...
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might have already guessed, this is a sample from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc&#34;&gt;swagger-jsdoc&lt;/a&gt;which takes the contents of the text after 
&lt;code&gt;@swagger&lt;/code&gt; and parses the contents of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://usejsdoc.org/&#34;&gt;jsdoc&lt;/a&gt; documentation into a &lt;a href=&#34;http://swagger.io/specification/&#34;&gt;swagger specification&lt;/a&gt;. This specification can be then visualized, for example, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K0swMwFEVHWqtcXnkxf0zg.png&#34; alt=&#34;nice swagger picture&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that I made the screenshot from the built of the example, not from this tiny sample, but you get the point ;) (Continue reading and you will see much nicer interface of the same info)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’m looking to improve this workflow even further (and make it more fun for developers to use the tool), I recently suggested a watch task in &lt;code&gt;swagger-jsdoc&lt;/code&gt; command line tool that works just like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ swagger-jsdoc -d swaggerDefinition.js routes.js routes2.js -w
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, after having a generated &lt;code&gt;swagger.json&lt;/code&gt; the command line will continue listening for changes in &lt;code&gt;routes.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;routes2.js&lt;/code&gt; and then re-generate the specification &lt;code&gt;swagger.json&lt;/code&gt; on updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also recently, the command line tool got a new feature to output &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; if the &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; flag is used like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ swagger-jsdoc -d swaggerDefinition.js apis.js -o swagger.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, &lt;code&gt;apis.js&lt;/code&gt; will be searched for &lt;code&gt;@swagger&lt;/code&gt; tags, but the parsed specification will be written to &lt;code&gt;swagger.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the &lt;code&gt;swagger.json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;swagger.yaml&lt;/code&gt; specification at this moment is a nice start. This file is the key re-usable resource that can be integrated with other tools such as &lt;code&gt;swagger-ui&lt;/code&gt; which visualize the “soul” of the API in nice UI interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-api-documentation-workflow&#34;&gt;Improved API documentation workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kalinchernev.github.io/images/swagger-jsdoc-improves-documentation-workflow.png&#34; alt=&#34;Improved documentation workflow with swagger-jsdoc&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, an article about &lt;a href=&#34;https://javascriptkicks.com/stories/94009/watching-file-changes-with-npm-scripts&#34;&gt;watching files changes with npm scripts got popular&lt;/a&gt;. I believe there is a reason why comments are not possible under the original article, but never mind, it got me on the path of researching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener&#34;&gt;fs.watch()&lt;/a&gt; and its behavior. After experimentation I reached to prefer &lt;code&gt;[chokidar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)&lt;/code&gt; which is a module improving the &lt;code&gt;fs.watch()&lt;/code&gt; interface. In fact, I liked &lt;code&gt;chokidar&lt;/code&gt; so much that I took the opportunity to suggest a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc/releases/tag/v1.9.0&#34;&gt;new feature in the CLI tool of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;[swagger-jsdoc](https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc/releases/tag/v1.9.0)&lt;/code&gt; which is, duh, a watch task working with the API files. (Briefly mentioned in the previous chapter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;chokidar&lt;/code&gt; module is also an integral part of the &lt;code&gt;[browser-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync)&lt;/code&gt; module which, in turn, an already mature and battle-tested piece of software. It is widely adopted in various products and projects to increase development experience and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having this understanding, I saw another opportunity — making a simple integration between instruments which integrate the &lt;code&gt;chokidar&lt;/code&gt; module. I only needed a better understanding of &lt;a href=&#34;http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/&#34;&gt;Swagger UI&lt;/a&gt; which is the “glue”, or the “contract”, between the back-end server side (the API) and the front-end (client) side. I feel it’s comfortable (and smart) that the documentation pages are the first-hand client and consumer of the API. Also, I believe that this consumer should be easy to make and maintain, but still really nice-looking, so that there is something pleasant for our paying clients to see. With &lt;code&gt;browser-sync&lt;/code&gt; Swagger UI got a bit more fun to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to demonstrate the idea better in visual and kinesthetic way, I created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/agile-open-api-docs&#34;&gt;supplementary repository&lt;/a&gt;. It contains examples of the first approach that came to my mind keeping &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle&#34;&gt;the KISS principle&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, there are few npm scripts that make the system work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you can have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/agile-open-api-docs/blob/master/package.json&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;[package.json](https://github.com/kalinchernev/agile-open-api-docs/blob/master/package.json)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/agile-open-api-docs/blob/master/package.json&#34;&gt;manifest&lt;/a&gt;. Tasks are separated in two main categories: tasks for the server side (the API) and tasks related to the documentation. For the API development part, &lt;code&gt;npm run api&lt;/code&gt; fires a server with &lt;code&gt;nodemon&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;swagger-jsdoc&lt;/code&gt; As a result, any changes in the &lt;code&gt;api/&lt;/code&gt; folder trigger server restart and re-generation of &lt;code&gt;swagger.json&lt;/code&gt; specification which goes to &lt;code&gt;api-docs/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the &lt;code&gt;npm run docs:develop&lt;/code&gt; task fires a &lt;code&gt;browser-sync&lt;/code&gt; server for the client side serving the &lt;code&gt;api-docs/&lt;/code&gt; folder which receives automatically updated &lt;code&gt;swagger.json&lt;/code&gt; specification from the previous task. You can run those two tasks in separate terminal sessions or just create another parallel task following the examples of the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file with &lt;code&gt;npm-run-all&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, you can freely update both the server and client sides of your project having near real-time feedback and results visible in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6bMTxVkYaUEEjyqpeiXBRA.png&#34; alt=&#34;Nice interface of the generated documentation&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering — why isn’t this the interface of Swagger UI I am used to seeing around! What happened? Well, I used a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jensoleg/swagger-ui&#34;&gt;fork which looks nicer&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an &lt;a href=&#34;http://swaggerui.herokuapp.com/?url=http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json#!/pet/addPet&#34;&gt;online demo&lt;/a&gt; which you can play with to get the feeling of what your documentation may look like after you enjoyably use &lt;code&gt;swagger-jsdoc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;browser-sync&lt;/code&gt; as shown in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/agile-open-api-docs/blob/master/package.json&#34;&gt;this repository.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same workflow is possible with other file extensions such as &lt;code&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; just changing the input parameters and removing the binding to the &lt;code&gt;nodemon&lt;/code&gt; server restart task, so that another standalone server is used instead. Here’s an example taken from a recent pull request which was included in &lt;code&gt;swagger-jsdoc&lt;/code&gt; to parse swagger documentation to &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*W72Xll_3kHjiCtNkb7U3qg.png&#34; alt=&#34;swagger-jsdoc with php projects&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;deployment&#34;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have intentionally left out the deployment part out of this story, because I believe there are many good options on the market and it really depends on the personal preferences how to manage this part of the process. For example, you can follow the scotch.io tutorial mentioned earlier to place the docs on heroku, or you can also include an npm script which works with &lt;code&gt;[gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages)&lt;/code&gt; to deploy the assets directly to your repository, etc. The main thing is that the &lt;code&gt;api-docs&lt;/code&gt; folder is already built and ready to be deployed as-is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myself, I plan to experiment with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/09/manage-your-APIs-with-Google-Cloud-Endpoints.html&#34;&gt;Google Endpoints&lt;/a&gt; in near future although it’s a new service. That’s because it supports the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/open-api-spec&#34;&gt;Open API specification&lt;/a&gt; and provides flexible options on deployment for both the API and the documentation on reasonable terms. An interesting point to notice is that the service guidelines show deployment only of the swagger/openapi specification file which can be generated by the &lt;code&gt;swagger-jsdoc&lt;/code&gt; This is a good example of re-using single specification for multiple purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QHvYcf7gyUyIwNlBo-jHTQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;swagger to open api specification transition&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing this article and sharing some code around it, I’m integrating tools that solve problems which have already been under the radar of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@apievangelist&#34;&gt;API Evangelist&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://apievangelist.com/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/&#34;&gt;the need of better API documentation and UI deployment&lt;/a&gt; which was later followed up by findings about &lt;a href=&#34;https://apievangelist.com/2015/06/27/the-responsive-swagger-driven-version-of-slate-api-documentation-i-was-looking-for/&#34;&gt;improved Swagger UI design solution&lt;/a&gt;. Few months ago, there was also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/16/learning-from-the-success-of-swagger-ui/&#34;&gt;reflection article about the success of Swagger UI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this article has inspired you to consider some new ways to improve your documentation workflows for your API project. I know that the idea of automated documentation generation with swagger tools is not new. Rather, I aim to introduce some new ideas on solving the problems which have been around on topic for a while with the tools available today to improve productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools shown in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/agile-open-api-docs&#34;&gt;the repository&lt;/a&gt; are free and vendor-neutral and the documentation build can be deployed to any place which serves you best. So, I encourage you to further experiment with the code and adapt it to work best for your specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you think this article was helpful, then consider making a comment, a share or a ❤&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/digital-beer/problem-first-problem-solving-87369b84551f?source=user_profile---------13-----------&#34; title=&#34;Permalink to Problem-first problem-solving – Digital Beer – Medium&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not going to be the next-generation framework for solving technical problems because it contains the word &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; twice. Apart from its negative charge, the core idea is as simple as focusing on the most important questions to answer before working on problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;problems&#34;&gt;Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems are addictive. As modern creatures, we need to have problems in order to have a reason to live. Solving problems brings positive feelings, like serotonin, which &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201211/the-neurochemicals-happiness&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;ultimately the link between higher serotonin and a lack of rejection sensitivity allows people to put themselves in situations that will bolster self-esteem, increase feelings of worthiness and create a sense of belonging.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in university, I quickly figured that semantically, and technically, the word &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; holds a different shade of meaning when logic kicks in: &amp;ldquo;an inquiry starting from given conditions to investigate or demonstrate a fact, result, or law.&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is perfectly valid to conclude that knowledge workers, like programmers, solve problems on a daily basis. Naturally, the process of solving problems becomes a brain habit, which mingles between the logical system of variables and the more humanistic problem solving psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal observation comes to that many people working in the technical sector (the IT sector) sometimes solve problems which are not really problems, because of lack of focus or because of a habit or inability to set the emotions and the psychology aside while solving logical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking/answering questions is the most natural way to manage attention and feelings. Questions are the leaders in both scenarios from above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that seniors in any knowledge worker profession are those who have accumulated experience of asking good questions for the problems they are supposed to solve. (And browsing well through the ocean of information after this&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate question one can ask recursively: &amp;ldquo;What am I really trying to solve here?&amp;rdquo; I believe that answering this question first, during meetings for example, could bring many positive outcomes without too many discussions and roundabouts which take attention and energy to focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tools-are-not-solving-problems-people-nbsp-are&#34;&gt;Tools are not solving problems, people&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a personal feeling and saying out loud: let&amp;rsquo;s please first find the problem we&amp;rsquo;re solving and then let&amp;rsquo;s look at the tools we&amp;rsquo;re using. Not to go into too many specifics of a profession, but I see so much energy being spent on things like: choosing programming languages, frameworks, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s so amazing sometimes to see projects like &lt;a href=&#34;https://lebab.io/&#34;&gt;lebab&lt;/a&gt;. I am sure that it&amp;rsquo;s solving real problems, however it&amp;rsquo;s not so obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My appeal here is simple: please consider the energy you will spend on tools well, and please base your solutions on real problems, rather than the inner drive to prove oneself as a great problem solver for quick gratification for solving insignificant problems or such that might not exist. That is touching upon the topic of the &amp;ldquo;fatigue&amp;rdquo; that developers complain about frequently. It&amp;rsquo;s a real feeling based on real situations in real life — having to solve many problems at the same time. Managing focus on using problem-first approach in our tool-chains and workflows is a vital part of preserving one&amp;rsquo;s energy and attention to what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;takeaways&#34;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although being pretty abstract, the paragraphs above aim to basically communicate the following ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems are addictive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solving problems feels good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions lead focus and attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attention should be invested into real problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tools when really necessary to keep sanity and solve real problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/digital-beer/holidays-digest-68ecc2b115a8&#34; title=&#34;Permalink to Holidays digest – Digital Beer – Medium&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to try a new format of writing a story — a &amp;ldquo;digest&amp;rdquo; one. In this format, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to mix subjects and share about things I find interesting. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to follow a strict structure, topics will be divided into sections to make it easy to jump between without having to read it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;medium&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the trending topic in the context of this blog is the story about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be#.yuaggxs6c&#34;&gt;Renewing Medium&amp;rsquo;s focus&lt;/a&gt;. I think there are few really good points about the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; and I hope that Medium will find the new way to provide the value they want for publishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;kadira&#34;&gt;Kadira&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, &lt;a href=&#34;https://voice.kadira.io/kadira-shutting-down-7d35994db85d#.mmph3hury&#34;&gt;Kadira: Shutting Down&lt;/a&gt; was an expected story from &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@arunoda&#34;&gt;Arunoda Susiripala&lt;/a&gt;. The decision is understandable from a business point of view. In a more global view, I feel that this story is a historic event for the JavaScript community in overall. It&amp;rsquo;s a reminder of how fierce the competition in the JavaScript ecosystem is and how important it is for vendors like MDG to manage their relations with driving contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;progressive-web-nbsp-apps&#34;&gt;Progressive Web&amp;nbsp;Apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last post was about &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev/think-about-apps-not-websites-13757f9736de#.5v5yhw1p3&#34;&gt;thinking about apps, not websites&lt;/a&gt;. My goal was to start a collection of good examples of making modern apps. I had plans to continue on this story-line by making a case study of an app with information about first aid that works offline, demonstrating both the technical and informational side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find a re-usable information about first aid was a tougher cookie that I thought. First, information on the web is not well structured. I was looking for a topical steps on how to help in a given urgent situation, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything organized. Secondly — the information was copyright and it would have taken a massive amount of waiting time to get information for a demo case study. I managed to find some open information in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/First_Aid&#34;&gt;wiki books&lt;/a&gt;, which got me started on the content. Finding free photos I could use was a bit easier as &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@disastacre&#34;&gt;Vladimir Vassilev&lt;/a&gt; suggested me a source collection of &lt;a href=&#34;http://re-wp.com/stock-photos/&#34;&gt;free stock photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I got my content prepared, the team of &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@auth0&#34;&gt;Auth0&lt;/a&gt; had already published 2 great articles on the same subject!&amp;nbsp;:D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one (actually the second one), which continued on the same story line as I aimed to, was about &lt;a href=&#34;https://auth0.com/blog/introduction-to-progressive-web-apps-instant-loading-part-2/&#34;&gt;instant loading and storage&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, I was testing &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache&#34;&gt;sw-precache&lt;/a&gt; more thoroughly and I had issues with the offline storage that erased the cache in an unpredictable ways on my mobile phone. Seeing that article during my work on the first aid case study, just discarded much of the things I wanted to share, as the article of &lt;a href=&#34;https://auth0.com/&#34;&gt;Auth0&lt;/a&gt; is much more thorough and deeper explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, just before NY, came the second nice article from the same team, this time about &lt;a href=&#34;https://auth0.com/blog/introduction-to-progressive-web-apps-push-notifications-part-3/&#34;&gt;push notifications&lt;/a&gt;. With this, I decided that it&amp;rsquo;s better to recommend these, rather than writing or trying to complete the first aid app. Mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it will be of any value added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you read this and still consider it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to make a progressive web app for first aid, then I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page&#34;&gt;wikibooks REST API&lt;/a&gt; to get the information about the book I linked earlier, following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Developer_app_guidelines&#34;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. From the little experience making the app, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/&#34;&gt;page.js&lt;/a&gt; and reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@krasimirtsonev&#34;&gt;Krasimir Tsonev&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/deep-dive-into-client-side-routing-navigo-pushstate-hash&#34;&gt;Deep dive into client-side routing&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s of course if you want to keep it simple, rather than using React (w/ react router) or Angular, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pishi-kur-18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pishikur.com/&#34;&gt;Pishi Kur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a tiny project that I released around Christmas. It&amp;rsquo;s just taking an example app from &lt;a href=&#34;https://firebase.google.com/&#34;&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt; and has some changed strings here and there. The idea of the project is to entertain Bulgarians travelling or living abroad by collecting pictures of a word. The idea came along in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plovdiv&#34;&gt;Plovdiv&lt;/a&gt; when few Bulgarians shared that they see that word in France, Germany, in the mountains, etc. The project will not be translated in Bulgarian and will not encourage vandalism, or anything like this. It&amp;rsquo;s rather a surrealistic platform of sharing funny moments while being in special places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also my first time to use Firebase. My impressions so far are positive: it was easy to setup the social authentication and deploy the app. The developer experience is close to what Meteor was about an year ago — easy development, ready plugin-like functionalities, etc. Only that, Meteor killed a lot of its interest by making Galaxy nothing more than a place to host your app, not providing a lot of services around it. With Firebase, Google services are easy to integrate at the finger tips of the developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, there are more than 30 registered users, average of 30 visits per day. If this grows organically, it will be an interesting case study to work with Firebase tools to scale and tweak the platform. Otherwise, I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to push advertising or any type of campaigns to make it bigger than that&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;apis&#34;&gt;APIs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling that I strayed a bit from this topic in the last few months, I renewed reading and researching ways to get my hands back on things about APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/how-i-made-a-saas-webservice-earning-1000-monthly-profit-6d2b782b95c8#.jrv7pfxuz&#34;&gt;How I made a SaaS webservice earning $1000 monthly profit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; is a motivating piece about taking small steps towards monetization of a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting piece of information is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.programmableweb.com/news/programmablewebs-most-interesting-apis-2016-application-development-and-developer-tools/brief/2016/12/23&#34;&gt;ProgrammableWeb&amp;rsquo;s Most Interesting APIs in 2016: Application Development and Developer Tools&lt;/a&gt;. I really love the idea of website to API tools like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jamapi.xyz/&#34;&gt;Jam API&lt;/a&gt; mentioned. It reminds me of &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kimonolabs&#34;&gt;Kimono Labs&lt;/a&gt; who got acquired almost an year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-jsdoc&#34;&gt;swagger-jsdoc&lt;/a&gt; module that I sometimes work on in my free time continue on its path of wider adoption:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yJ4w5B4sAANmTqrJlHpcFw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data from &lt;https: npm-stat.com=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be that the CLI tool played an important role in August. And because the module targets the developers&amp;rsquo; audience, I plan to work on a feature to &amp;ldquo;watch&amp;rdquo; for changes in the input files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it&amp;rsquo;s worth investing in learning and doing more of swagger apis this year, mainly for 2 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trends look good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bVdbmTcQZsE4tYunE7Jh5Q.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=swagger%20api&#34;&gt;Google&amp;nbsp;Trends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adoption of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openapis.org/&#34;&gt;Open API specification&lt;/a&gt; also looks positive, and also the big players also support it. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to say what exactly will happen in 2017 after some of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/the-era-of-apis/over-500m-invested-in-api-companies-in-2016-with-16-acquisitions-cc4f3d2beef8#.99codaicj&#34;&gt;acquisitions of 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, my gut feeling is that having a solid specification (with such adoption) is a key to having the true interoperability to other specifications and solutions such as GraphQL, in potential interest &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@raxwunter/moving-existing-api-from-rest-to-graphql-205bab22c184#.h6rctdrxm&#34;&gt;moving existing API from REST to GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-chat-bot-story-32-became-my-best-story-of-2016-because-of-chatbots-life-33-publication&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chatbotslife.com/building-a-chat-bot-who-understands-emotions-though-your-selfies-e9fa7cc4b627#.rgfcezwnz&#34;&gt;My chat bot story&lt;/a&gt; became my best story of 2016 because of &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@ChatBotsLife&#34;&gt;Chatbots Life&lt;/a&gt; publication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being published on 1st December, and being one my last articles for 2016, the &amp;ldquo;Building a chat bot who understands emotions though your selfies&amp;rdquo; story grew to be my best story of the year, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kojouharov&#34;&gt;Stefan Kojouharov&lt;/a&gt; including it in a publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HgTPQnk-aW0wxKdFitxtzg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only story that could have been a competition in fame to this one was the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev/drupal-8-on-cloud9-ide-1a294328e1aa#.g3a7u6t68&#34;&gt;Drupal 8 on Cloud9 IDE&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which got more views because of being included in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theweeklydrop.com/archive/issue-258&#34;&gt;Weekly Drop issue 258&lt;/a&gt;, but didn&amp;rsquo;t reach as many number of reads and recommends.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Think about apps, not websites</title>
      <link>https://kalinchernev.github.io/think-about-apps-not-websites/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kalinchernev.github.io/think-about-apps-not-websites/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Admiring the progress of &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API&#34;&gt;Web APIs&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to shortly summarize some feelings. They are mostly about a borderline (common-sense) why it is worth knowing what is a web app and why we have to shift our paradigm thinking from building websites to building web apps. For this reason, I include few steps as a tutorial to encourage hands-on experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;state-of-internet&#34;&gt;State of internet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/#chart_trend&#34;&gt;more than 40% of the world has access to the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, and this number is yet to grow having in mind the vast popularity of campaigns which ensure that each one in the world is connected. It seems that we are in rush to make the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_village_%28term%29&#34;&gt;Global village reality&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I still remember when making a dynamic website with mobile-friendly design was innovation, however, it’s simply &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/majority-of-digital-media-consumption-now-takes-place-in-mobile-apps/&#34;&gt;not anything special any more&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the digital world is much more accessible than before with smart-watches, smart-TVs, VRs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past. —&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&#34;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reality-check&#34;&gt;Reality check&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the new software or hardware technologies do not make any sense if not used properly and effectively. For example, managing our user data and documents synchronization in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing&#34;&gt;the cloud&lt;/a&gt; is a vital skill you have to master. This way, you can take advantage of the technological opportunities of keeping your information safe and available anywhere you have a browser and an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs,_Sheets_and_Slides&#34;&gt;Google docs&lt;/a&gt; got available to us a decade ago, and Microsoft followed with their &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneDrive&#34;&gt;OneDrive&lt;/a&gt; few years later. So, regardless of the device (tablet, laptop, PC, etc.) we can work with our documents through our browser, AND have a safe backup of our work. Not taking advantage of cloud technologies to have synchronized backup of our important documents is a missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a website that shows only information is a missed opportunity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that? Well, simple — the problems we are solving today are different than the problems we were solving 10 years ago. Even if the criticism of the accelerated change were true, why would we encounter so many examples of transformation we did not anticipate with this speed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example higher user expectation: being able to work with mobile applications offline. A decade ago, a website was a good solution to having an online presence, i.e. having a business card, etc. Probably printing pages was ok. However, today, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pcworld.com/article/3145946/streaming-services/you-can-finally-watch-netflix-offline-now.html&#34;&gt;Netflix offline capabilities&lt;/a&gt; or editing documents in Google Drive offline mode are making customers happy, because users are mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In similar conditions, building a website to just share information is not something special any more, because users expect a whole different, more engaging digital experience — think about SMS notifications. They were standard some years ago, but not anymore. Today, push notifications are everywhere. And there is no way that trend goes down, as the future connected world will involve even higher amount of notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;web-apps&#34;&gt;Web apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Web apps” is probably something you already know. Web apps are consisted of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Difference between them and regular websites, is that the same technologies are used with “spices”: new methods to achieve better results. Meet the Progressive Web Apps, aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/&#34;&gt;PWA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term has been around for awhile, so starter tutorials are accessible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, there are many benefits of adding an some extra efforts into your existing (or new) web pages to make them available in bad network conditions (when offline), and provide functionalities that are normally expected by users in mobile, but in the browser. And browsers are something you have almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a decision maker or a company owner with a business around &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html&#34;&gt;Chrome Apps or extensions&lt;/a&gt;, you have an even bigger motivation to follow this trend, in order to maintain your business in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, get into the habit to use your browser effectively as a tool in your skill-set of the future :) Even if you are not a developer, you have to imagine that at some point of time, &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/swlh/browsers-not-apps-are-the-future-of-mobile-c552752ff75#.ackczpqrj&#34;&gt;the browser will be the app you are running everywhere&lt;/a&gt; regardless of your operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a bonus for seasoned developers reaching this point of the article: this &lt;a href=&#34;https://auth0.com/blog/chromedevsummit-summary/&#34;&gt;summary of chrome dev summit&lt;/a&gt; would be worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-a-web-app&#34;&gt;Making a web app&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve marked some initial milestones that worked for me, the order shouldn’t be important, but that’s more or less how I see the process — hopefully easy to understand and follow with a bit of hands-on practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be going through the most popular and basic features of PWA which could complement existing websites and make them more app-like. I believe that gradual improvements in existing websites is a good strategy for making the best of the modern web, while avoiding regressions in working solutions. This way, everybody win — business owners invest smartly into new enhancements, developers upgrade their solutions taking small doable steps, also, the end-user (the king) receives improved experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what we want to achieve is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User can save our application to his phone for quick access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User can open the application without access to the Internet, and still see meaningful contents that help him continue working with the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;devtools&#34;&gt;DevTools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before kicking off the tutorial part, please, use Google Chrome while working out the rest of the items — ensuring you have really great experience and least amount of hurdles on browser support during your journey. Firefox, Edge and Opera could be alternatives, however, Chrome has the best support for modern JavaScript at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is an entertaining summary of the documentation about &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/progressive-web-apps&#34;&gt;debugging progressive web apps with Chrome DevTools&lt;/a&gt;. Most certainly, general familiarity with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/&#34;&gt;DevTools&lt;/a&gt; would help you understand it, although the panel for debugging PWA is much simpler than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IWgNn1kqrsA?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-a-manifest-file&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a manifest file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manifest file should comply to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://w3c.github.io/manifest/&#34;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; which serves a similar purpose as of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest&#34;&gt;Chrome Platform API manifest file&lt;/a&gt; — it&amp;rsquo;s a set of definitions. &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android&#34;&gt;The installation of a web app&lt;/a&gt; is more engaging than the one of a native app, i.e. one doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to go to a &amp;ldquo;store&amp;rdquo;, but take it right away. Note that a service worker file should be loaded (and activated, etc.) to achieve this interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DYjPm6A9VuxueEU7mD_lPQ.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image taken from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this article, these are the criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;definition manifest file is present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the manifest file contains at least the following properties: &lt;code&gt;short_name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;144x144&lt;/code&gt; PNG icon with its corresponding mime type meta info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;app is served over HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user has visited your site at least twice, with at least five minutes between visits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, this year &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/topic/instant-apps/index.html&#34;&gt;instant apps&lt;/a&gt; were announced. They are something similar for Android native apps. It seems like a unified direction into making the content and functionalities more accessible for the user. For the install, If you have a native app, and you want to suggest it to the user, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android#native&#34;&gt;use the manifest for this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/push-notifications/good-notification#dont-advertise-native&#34;&gt;do NOT advertise the native app via a push notification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try and experiment with this basic step, take either any of the tutorials in &lt;a href=&#34;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/&#34;&gt;codelabs&lt;/a&gt; or by use &lt;a href=&#34;https://googlesamples.github.io/&#34;&gt;sample snippets&lt;/a&gt; (don&amp;rsquo;t really know if it&amp;rsquo;s the same as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chromestatus.com/samples&#34;&gt;chrome samples&lt;/a&gt;), or just clone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/pwa/tree/basics/manifest&#34;&gt;this branch&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m personally using &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev/cloud9-ide-6e26940c6130#.cotqpyn8b&#34;&gt;cloud9 editor&lt;/a&gt; for development, as it serves the applications over HTTPS by default, which is really convenient to just go and try things. There are many alternatives for both the editor and server: just choose what works best for you and don&amp;rsquo;t over-think or over-prepare, focus on the doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of this, you must already have a feeling of achievement! Creating a manifest file that loads some assets and an empty JavaScript file is easy, but rewarding enough to keep your momentum to continue further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, testing the behavior of &amp;ldquo;Add to homescreen&amp;rdquo; in both the desktop browser and the mobile phone, you will surely notice that &amp;ldquo;homescreen&amp;rdquo; of the browser is the browser&amp;rsquo;s home of apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L63xgn3aL-6YTv7LnpwpVQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;add to homescreen behavior on your desktop&amp;nbsp;browser&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#dfn-display-mode&#34;&gt;`display mode&lt;/a&gt;` the app can run in a separate standalone window that looks like a desktop app (and in mobile it looks like mobile), by hiding the address bar. This is how &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps&#34;&gt;Chrome Apps&lt;/a&gt; should be build in the future too, not only websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mowO5VIVEwFBcOJcXY4OUQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same app open in a normal browser and in a standalone window&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same code (HTML+CSS+manifest file and an empty JavaScript file loaded as a service worker) produce good mobile experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qDNI5CsWyWWPty5qcM6KaA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add to home screen is same as installing the app on the&amp;nbsp;device&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the icon is added to the desktop as expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*u1QOfgyz4iEdl1dZ2zrDPg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and when the icon is clicked, the user gets a nice welcoming screen, colors defined as &lt;code&gt;theme_color&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;background_color&lt;/code&gt; properties in the manifest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HLOcyRrmJu2AvKN4aqrlCQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in standalone display mode, no URL address bar is visible. Use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=best+mobile-first+CSS+frameworks+today&#34;&gt;good front-end framework&lt;/a&gt; to make the look and feel of your web page as a native app — the user will be delighted!&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-app-nbsp-shell&#34;&gt;The app&amp;nbsp;shell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s mostly conceptual yet important task to think about: in order to deliver good user experience, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to have access to fundamental assets offline in order to react well in case of a network going offline. So, when you build and develop your web site, consider it&amp;rsquo;s a real shell that stays the same and only the contents is changing. This article gives good &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell&#34;&gt;concept overview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not something super-new for people who are used to thinking about apps already, or developers of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&#34;&gt;SPAs&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s just something to always have in the back of your mind when you look at your own website — what resources are important to deliver to the user even when he&amp;rsquo;s offline? What are the repetitive elements of my web pages? Normally these are the navigation and its surroundings. All these become the &amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo;, being cached on the device for easy access, and the content is dynamically fetched when available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dEvx7lPNJT-r-tKjqvAXxg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell&#34;&gt;Image credits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement this strategy for saving resources, one must know how to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache&#34;&gt;Cache API&lt;/a&gt; through a service worker. The API can also be accessed through the global &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; object as well, but working through a SW, we can &amp;ldquo;hook&amp;rdquo; into the events in the worker&amp;rsquo;s life-cycle, i.e. we can validate cache when network connection toggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-a-servic-worker&#34;&gt;Creating a servic worker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications — functionality that would normally require a native application — are coming to the web. Service workers provide the technical foundation that all these features rely on. — taken from &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers&#34;&gt;Service Workers: an Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In basic terms, the service worker is a proxy layer between your stack (HTML+CSS+JS) and the network. The API of service workers boost the functionality of your otherwise normal web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good starting point could be the sample for &lt;a href=&#34;https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/custom-offline-page/index.html&#34;&gt;Service Worker Sample: Custom Offline Page Sample&lt;/a&gt;. If the amount of code seems too much, have a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/service-worker-libraries/&#34;&gt;tools section&lt;/a&gt; where some libraries are already published to make these functionalities more accessible. For example, if your project uses a task runner, you can implement &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#install&#34;&gt;`sw-precache&lt;/a&gt;` (&lt;a href=&#34;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/sw-precache/#0&#34;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is also available&amp;nbsp;;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, it was fun to play a bit with the service worker file, not having access to the DOM directly, but yet having a Web API that should communicate with it was an interesting thing. In the end, I used the example code provided in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache/tree/master/demo&#34;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;sw-precache&lt;/code&gt; because I&amp;rsquo;m really lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the exercise, I have this branch for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/pwa/tree/basics/caching&#34;&gt;the basics of caching the application shell&lt;/a&gt;. What I really like as a side-effect of stealing the gulp file of the demo above is that now I have a basic build system. That helps me in generating a comparatively sophisticated service-worker handling the offline behavior of my web app. Also, it gives me a nicely working &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;gh-pages website&lt;/a&gt; that can be accessed by anyone over HTTPS on &lt;https: kalinchernev.github.io=&#34;&#34; pwa=&#34;&#34;&gt; This makes me really happy, because of several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already have a self-hosted, manageable (easy to update and deploy), modern web app, that looks like a mobile app. It can be viewed and installed on a mobile device, and later opened in a &amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo;, i.e. not showing broken pages offline mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a task runner like &lt;a href=&#34;http://gulpjs.com/&#34;&gt;gulp&lt;/a&gt; opens a door of opportunities to make my development life even easier than before: I can integrate live reload, include any preprocessing of LESS/SASS, can include babel to turn my ES6 code in ES5 for older browsers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;sw-precache&lt;/code&gt; even as simple as it is right now, provides me with benefits of easier asset management, as I don&amp;rsquo;t have to go too much into the details of the Cache API if I don&amp;rsquo;t want to, and the mechanism of implementing the worker is easier to update in the future, as I believe the project will be well maintained. So, my task for future maintenance will be to re-generate the worker which is already included on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you already see more opportunities than before. In particular, next time you want to publish information that is important and useful for your users when, say, they travel, consider these options. Imagine you want to provide accessible guides and documentation — just follow the same steps and provide enhanced experience, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;ll pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;push-notification&#34;&gt;Push notification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me briefly indicate some resources that I consider useful for the topic, without going into details, as this feature is going a bit beyond the browser and won&amp;rsquo;t be as beginner-friendly as I&amp;rsquo;d like it to be. This topic deserves another separate article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a start, you can start with &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/push-notifications/&#34;&gt;Adding Push Notifications to a Web App&lt;/a&gt;. It can be well-complemented with &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Push_API/Using_the_Push_API&#34;&gt;Using the Push API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/dev-channel/designing-a-web-push-service-3076c0599f3e#.6xi4d77ds&#34;&gt;Designing a Web Push Service&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@paul_kinlan&#34;&gt;Paul Kinlan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-future&#34;&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from being bright, it will be filled with advancements and further variety in the developers&amp;rsquo; toolbox. Having in mind that browsers have always been an inconsistent environment, it will be vital to keep the following resources at hand and get fresh information every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive&#34;&gt;MDN App Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/&#34;&gt;Google Web Updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.chrome.com/home&#34;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/#aJK7cy6m0YfVUByl.97&#34;&gt;Microsoft Edge&lt;/a&gt;, etc. of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/&#34;&gt;HTML5Rocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/&#34;&gt;The standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to underline, that &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@nekrtemplar/progressive-web-apps-aint-google-s-thing-31ca581e7a1#.faazl83yx&#34;&gt;Progressive Web Apps isn&amp;rsquo;t a Google-only thing&lt;/a&gt; although many of the references in this article are going to resources authored by community contributions to Google documentation. This is mainly because the dedication and organization of knowledge seems to the best at the moment. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/07/08/the-progress-of-web-apps/#ZeJAshXJM2BuqDRB.97&#34;&gt;Microsoft are also supporters of PWA&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;http://manifoldjs.com&#34;&gt;manifoldjs&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting project you will probably meet should you decide to make PWA that works as a nice app in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Web APIs will surely continue to evolve. You can bookmark the good ol&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://caniuse.com/#search=push&#34;&gt;caniuse.com&lt;/a&gt; to verify whether an API you want to use is supported natively or you&amp;rsquo;ll have to search for a shim/polyfill and similar. Of course, there are many existing libraries and frameworks which are already taking developers attention (causing fatigue&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I speak about experimental features that will change, but I firmly believe that browser vendors are on a good way of collaborating to support native APIs more consistently rapidly in very near future, so these features will be standard before you realize it. Knowing the standards helps you produce more maintainable code and gives you a good idea about the direction of Web, regardless of the popularity and influence of vendor frameworks and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are simple steps that anyone can take in order to convert their existing websites and web pages in progressive web apps, i.e. pages with HTML+CSS+JavaScript which act like native apps for important functionalities. Installation, caching and push notifications are a growing trend for a reason — they increase user engagement and provide great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, during the upcoming holidays, have a look at the following Web APIs, and hopefully play with them, provide more value via your web pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a &lt;code&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; file describing your app with its assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement caching for the vital assets necessary when offline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a simple push notification for events of new content on your pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, using native Web APIs will be fun during this experimentation, as &lt;a href=&#34;http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/&#34;&gt;Chrome supports a lot of ES6 features&lt;/a&gt; and there is no need for you to transpile your code to see immediate results of your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and good luck!&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Triage stream-adventure issue queue</title>
      <link>https://kalinchernev.github.io/stream-adventure-triage/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kalinchernev.github.io/stream-adventure-triage/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/workshopper/stream-adventure&#34;&gt;stream-adventure&lt;/a&gt; is one of the first &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodeschool.io/about.html&#34;&gt;workshopper&lt;/a&gt; node modules which teaches &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html&#34;&gt;Streams&lt;/a&gt; in node.js. Working on the challenges myself, I got frustrated when simple things did not work for me, so I ended up on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/workshopper/stream-adventure&#34;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt; doing a bit of triage during my free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-project-why-how&#34;&gt;The project: why &amp;amp; how&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Why&lt;/strong&gt;: stream-adventure is a popular project among developers who want to learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt; and its Streams API which is fundamental. The “workshopper” provides simple and doable steps for learning the subject matter in a practical way . Also, the project is pointed as a historic milestone of &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodeschool.io/about.html&#34;&gt;nodeschool&lt;/a&gt;. Accodring to me, it’s good value: &lt;em&gt;learning node.js while contributing back to a big-impact project&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How&lt;/strong&gt;: installing the project is the same as any other &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/package/stream-adventure#install&#34;&gt;node module&lt;/a&gt;. You can do that either locally (when having node+npm) or by using a cloud service like &lt;a href=&#34;https://kalinchernev.github.io/cloud9-editor&#34;&gt;Cloud 9 IDE&lt;/a&gt;. I use C9 as it’s convenient to work on the challenges any time and anywhere, in the browser, and the environment has nvm, which makes it easy for me to switch between node versions in case I need to test something special.
That’s how it looks — not so bad ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1400/1*ha_bEZaLR_t9Kc13Tac-Qw.png&#34; alt=&#34;workshopper on cloud9 editor&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I recently got feedback similar to &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/cloud9-requiring-credit-card/23482&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; about a requirement of a credit card during registration in C9. Remember that the choice of tools is always up to a personal preferences, i.e. feel free to choose whatever works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To possible program commands, run &lt;code&gt;stream-adventure help&lt;/code&gt;. Most of the time, you’ll need only &lt;code&gt;stream-adventure&lt;/code&gt;, stream-adventure print and &lt;code&gt;stream-adventure verify program.js&lt;/code&gt; where the program.js is the file containing your solution of the given challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reporting-issues&#34;&gt;Reporting issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting issues is really good! Only one suggestion: search the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/workshopper/stream-adventure/issues&#34;&gt;issue queue&lt;/a&gt; and or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/workshopper/stream-adventure/pulls&#34;&gt;list of pull requests&lt;/a&gt; to check if the issue you’re experiencing is not already reported or worked upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, if the issue is already reported or worked upon, try to support the people working on it in order to speed up the process of solving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-on-the-issue-nbsp-queue&#34;&gt;Working on the issue&amp;nbsp;queue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wanted to work on the queue for my own benefit of figuring out what is what, etc. initially, I started working in one way and changed my approach on the way. The goal was simple: organize issues and pull request in an effective way for a maintainer to quickly and easily take yes/no decision on solving a given problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy 1: Prioritize pull requests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am a &amp;ldquo;newbie&amp;rdquo; in both the subject of matter (the streams) and in the project, my first idea was to go through the list of pull requests and categorize them in a way that indicates the readiness to be merged. This way, I imagine, the pull requests being validated and tested can be quickly skimmed and hopefully merged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy didn&amp;rsquo;t work very effective for me, since the process was not linear, i.e. frequently I open 1 pull request which solves 1 issue, and then from this issue, I tend to find related or duplicates, and what if there are other pull requests that solve the same issue in another way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that strategy could be effective if the project has a roadmap or a well-defined list of important bugs/features to be handled in a given sprint or milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy 2: Work-out &amp;ldquo;low-hanging fruits&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy seemed a natural reflex for quick gratification after the first strategy didn&amp;rsquo;t work quite well&amp;nbsp;:) The idea is simple: go through issues and find such that are either already solved, duplicates, general questions that are already answered successfully, old issues that are not valid any more, etc. These are quick-wins that give a good feeling similar to the one that you experience when you cross an item from the todo list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this strategy could be the starting point, rather than a bounce-back reflex as I did. The process of sorting easy or already done issues is a low-barrier entrance into the issue queue. And it naturally leads to the need of reading/searching other related issues which is something that has to be done at any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy 3: Categorize issues by topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This small and probably super-obvious step was actually more gratifying than the low-handing fruits. At this stage, I decided that the process of triage the issue queue will be a complementary activity to my own learning path of the module. So, I made a list of the issues, categorized by the topic of the workshopper, i.e. &amp;ldquo;concat&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;http_server&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;http_client&amp;rdquo;, etc. and then sorted them in the same way as I would go through them in the workshopper. This way, I reached a natural flow of working on the problem myself trying to solve it (experiencing the same problems as I&amp;rsquo;d see in the issue queue) and then going through the list of related issues and pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the sole act of first doing the challenge myself and then reading information and reports about the issue gives a very good background and picture on the way I&amp;rsquo;d approach the issues and the pull requests. Sometimes opening a pull request suggesting an update in the problem definition could be solving many issues coming from misunderstanding the problem or misunderstanding the expected code implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy 4: Prioritize most recent communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s an approach of working out issues in open source projects in software or software modules that one does not necessarily use directly everyday or is not affected/blocked at a current time. I didn&amp;rsquo;t prioritize latest communication at this triage because the project is not so big and there aren&amp;rsquo;t so many issues or pull requests. In case the project involves thousand of developers or sub-functionalities that are not easy to see or figure out, but still feels good to contribute back, that strategy could be useful to get into effective flow of solving problems that are important/actual/active at the current moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy 5: Follow your own interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way of strategy 3, which involved prioritizing issues by topic, I could say that it&amp;rsquo;s pretty important to work on issues that are genuinely interesting for oneself. This means that, even if the project was bigger and harder to maintain, the passion which someone has about a topic would always win over a non-interested trivial going through the issue queue solving issues that are not really motivation enough to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;your-feedback-is-nbsp-valuable&#34;&gt;Your feedback is&amp;nbsp;valuable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize this meta-article, your feedback on both the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/workshopper/stream-adventure/issues&#34;&gt;repository of the project&lt;/a&gt; and my thoughts are very welcome&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing is caring!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a node.js client for the EU Open Data Portal</title>
      <link>https://kalinchernev.github.io/eu-data-portal-nodejs-client/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2016 12:10:11 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kalinchernev.github.io/eu-data-portal-nodejs-client/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Planning to make an open data GraphQL server, it was natural to first build a small abstraction wrapper which can be re-used in other projects. Basically, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/package/odp&#34;&gt;odp library&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about is just a simplified client for fetching data from the EU Open Data Portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-the-library&#34;&gt;Getting the library&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/en/&#34;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;, the module can be installed by npm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ npm install odp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;library-api&#34;&gt;Library API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API of the module is pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34;&gt;// Get a range of the whole list of datasets:
odp.getDatasets({query: {limit: 100, offset: 1}}).then((data) =&amp;gt; {
  console.log(data);
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are 4 methods which match the brief information from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/developerscorner&#34;&gt;developers&amp;rsquo; corner&lt;/a&gt;. Methods are: &lt;code&gt;getDatasets()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getTags()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getDataset()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;datasetSearch()&lt;/code&gt;. It could be that there are more options than that in the API, but these are all I know so far as user of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/odp/blob/master/README.md#examples&#34;&gt;Examples section&lt;/a&gt; is included in the README file for further details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions and pull requests are welcome at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/odp&#34;&gt;github page of the project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Drupal 8 on Cloud9 IDE</title>
      <link>https://kalinchernev.github.io/drupal8-cloud9-ide/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kalinchernev.github.io/drupal8-cloud9-ide/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You see things; and you say, &amp;lsquo;Why?&amp;rsquo; But I dream things that never were; and I say, &amp;lsquo;Why not?&amp;ldquo; — George Bernard Shaw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/8&#34;&gt;Drupal 8&lt;/a&gt; will soon celebrate 1 year since its release. One interesting fact about this version of the popular PHP CMS is that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/core/release-cycle-overview&#34;&gt;release cycles&lt;/a&gt; are smaller and feature-focused. This makes everybody happier than previous major versions and I will focus on developers&amp;rsquo; experience. It&amp;rsquo;s been steadily improving since the focused adoption of popular and well-maintained projects from the wide PHP community. &lt;a href=&#34;https://getcomposer.org/&#34;&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://drupalconsole.com/&#34;&gt;Drupal Console&lt;/a&gt; (an implementation of Symfony Console) and adopting PHP OOP design patterns in overall are some of the highlights in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&#34;http://c9.io&#34;&gt;Cloud9 Editor&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting project to my personal experience as a developer. I&amp;rsquo;ve shared some enthusiasm about it before, summarizing &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev/cloud9-ide-6e26940c6130#.nxqgf2ree&#34;&gt;some of my favorite features&lt;/a&gt;, and going deeper into &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev/debugging-node-js-in-cloud9-ide-59712c043fb2#.tknem3kcp&#34;&gt;debugging applications in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;. At this step, I start to dream about scenarios where this cloud editor will be THE editor for massive amount of open source contributors, experimenters and agile practitioners alike. I also visualize scenarios where it could fill in the gap in the hearts of many who use tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://dreditor.org/&#34;&gt;dreditor&lt;/a&gt;. Dreditor on steroids: git, drush, mysql, php, etc — all the tools a developer needs to start, test, develop and deploy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;repository-based-development-environment&#34;&gt;Repository based development environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project&#34;&gt;Drupal Composer&amp;rsquo;s drupal-project&lt;/a&gt; seems like a really interesting repository which can enable me to start a Drupal 8 project and make an installation. Also it will provide me with a door of opportunities to manage all my project-global dependencies via composer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I can do to start a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/getting-started&#34;&gt;Cloud9 workspace&lt;/a&gt; linked my own fork repository of the drupal-project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forked the original repo to my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kalinchernev/drupal-project&#34;&gt;drupal-project repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new workspace pointing to the my fork repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selecting template &amp;ldquo;The popular stack in shiny cloud wrappings: Apache, PHP5 and MySQL pre-configured&amp;rdquo; seems ok for the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should look similar to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nbj-D9ufx-wlGZ-MdBj6Jw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating my new development environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this process, I have an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntu.com/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;docker&lt;/a&gt; container. In it, there is a local repository linked to my upstream repository on the origin. I&amp;rsquo;m ready to use the tools I know in Linux because composer, npm, node, etc. are already installed, and I also have a command line interface to run or install anything I need on top of this initial setup. As a side note, &lt;a href=&#34;https://c9.io/community/templates&#34;&gt;custom templates&lt;/a&gt; will soon make this initial setup even more flexible and personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the terminal is already open for you, run &lt;code&gt;git remote -v&lt;/code&gt; to ensure this origin linking if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;selecting-drupal-nbsp-8&#34;&gt;Selecting Drupal&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the workspace is ready, you have to select a branch for the Drupal version you are going to work with. I&amp;rsquo;m going to do &lt;code&gt;git checkout 8.x&lt;/code&gt; in the ternimal to use the 8.x version of the the repository files in the container machine. When you do that, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the files in the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Eoo2-TstzN_2AtY1m4kagw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 branch of the repository&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the source files I can use to build the project with the dependencies and the tools of my personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-project-dependencies&#34;&gt;Building project dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dependencies can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#dependency-management&#34;&gt;managed globally for the project&lt;/a&gt; via the composer.json file. What interests me the most are the Drupal, Drupal Console and Drush which are already &lt;a href=&#34;https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#the-require-key&#34;&gt;required&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3AcZBLBGsVdelfdFPJcmMw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal-specific initial dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the readme file of the repo points out, additional dependencies can be added later by &lt;a href=&#34;https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#installing-dependencies&#34;&gt;installing dependencies through the composer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;composer install&lt;/code&gt; in the terminal to download all the dependencies and run all the composer special things defined in the composer.json file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all downloads are finished — you can just run the Run button and start the apache server in the machine to open the project in the project browser or your own browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Wk4VtthU1g6TbvI70Q7u3Q.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the project in the browser after the dependencies installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you resist your perfectionist nature and expectations on domain names, now you can open the project at &lt;a href=&#34;https://%7Bprojectname%7D-%7Busername%7D.c9users.io/web/core/install.php&#34;&gt;https://{projectname}-{username}.c9users.io/web/core/install.php&lt;/a&gt; replacing the variables of course. And there you go, you have Drupal 8 ready for your install!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZOtYTj11S-Mi9h_894NoMA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, the wizard is&amp;nbsp;ready!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;installing-the-nbsp-project&#34;&gt;Installing the&amp;nbsp;project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deliberately left this out from the previous one. You can, of course, continue with the installation in the most user-friendly way with the wizard above. Classical and easy and you don&amp;rsquo;t worry even for file permissions. If you are a databases guy, probably you&amp;rsquo;ll be interested to check the tutorial for &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-mysql/1718&#34;&gt;setting up mysql&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/setup-a-database&#34;&gt;setting up a database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option for making the installation is using the command line interface and Drupal Console. If you&amp;rsquo;re a non-idealist developer, you can directly run the binary from the vendor folder like &lt;code&gt;/vendor/bin/drupal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dx0IRYUqpwRv512zYSBGJg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal Console initialization&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will hint you to run an initial setup for the tool, just do it and then you can have &lt;a href=&#34;https://hechoendrupal.gitbooks.io/drupal-console/content/en/commands/site-install.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;vendor/bin/drupal site:install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more ideas around this installation step, check &lt;a href=&#34;https://drupalconsole.com/articles/how-to-download-and-install-drupal-8-using-drupal-console&#34;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; which also includes steps to download the project if it was not done by Composer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shooting some ideas of a quick-start yml file for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.drupalconsole.com/en/commands/chain.html&#34;&gt;`chain&lt;/a&gt;`.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;&gt;commands:
# Install Drupal
  - command: site:install
    options:
      langcode: &#39;en&#39;

      account-pass: &#39;admin&#39; # default pass
    arguments:
      profile: &#39;standard&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;debugging&#34;&gt;Debugging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small helper subject after the setup — since xdebug is available in the docker in &amp;ldquo;Apache &amp;amp; PHP&amp;rdquo; runner, there is a way to debug apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start &amp;ldquo;Apache &amp;amp; PHP&amp;rdquo; runner with debugger on:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ksgXbNGH5Lp_HtVdLoQWMA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green debugger button is the important detail to&amp;nbsp;notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a break-point and open the application to trigger a request:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*26fDzn9eaCW1fwMcB9BSEQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app can be run either in preview in the IDE or in another&amp;nbsp;tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect the state of the system and profit from deeper understanding&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lfPKCwwocB8NkegBzv7fOA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the inspector for observing both global and local&amp;nbsp;scopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the runner properties can be edited:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m1WawXoob6Jg7DiUIlN9hg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Runners are editable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// This file overrides the built-in Apache httpd (PHP, HTML) runner
// For more information see http://docs.c9.io:8080/#!/api/run-method-run
{

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an ambitious initiative/dream to work with Drupal 8 projects in the cloud but you see that it&amp;rsquo;s possible and easy. In the end of this tutorial you have a working instance built out of a composer-based dependency management system, your custom repository, and the vital tools to help you develop well: Drupal Console, Drush and any other script you can think of that run on an Ubuntu machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to use these tools to your best interest: teaching Drupal 8 interactively, pair-programming, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/contributor-tasks/triage-novice-issues&#34;&gt;triage&lt;/a&gt; issues by making/testing patches or just experimenting with features you&amp;rsquo;re interested in anywhere, anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debugging node.js in Cloud9 IDE</title>
      <link>https://kalinchernev.github.io/debugging-nodejs-in-cloud9-ide/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing some of my level-up experience learning how to debug node.js apps. It was not easy at first, but once I got it, I felt empowered that now I can work with any code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging is useful for solving vague problems in other people&amp;rsquo;s code and it&amp;rsquo;s also useful for learning how something actually works. The article might be particularly useful for those used to having debugger experience in WebStorm or similar IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;quick-reference&#34;&gt;Quick reference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That article is meant to be more like a cheat sheet rather than too detailed step by step guide, here&amp;rsquo;s a go-to list of techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;node-debugger&#34;&gt;Node debugger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by the basics — using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html&#34;&gt;node&amp;rsquo;s native debugger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc/blob/master/example/app.js&#34;&gt;this app&lt;/a&gt; contains a simple server returning a JSON object which is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&amp;amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG4Pi0qfbOAhUEOhQKHaQICOAQFggcMAA&amp;amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fswagger.io%2Fspecification%2F&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH_jZB7rkJVVCg-JHFmeLAHwMnUfw&amp;amp;amp;sig2=R2rG7_9EH1ctFeFwtJ7cPw&amp;amp;amp;bvm=bv.131783435,d.d24&#34;&gt;swagger specification&lt;/a&gt; and I need to debug and see its value. So, in this example, I&amp;rsquo;ll follow this steps to see the contents of the variable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a break point with &lt;code&gt;debugger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the script with &lt;code&gt;node debug example/app.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with the controls of the debugger to reach a good value: &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; to continue and &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; for next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;repl&lt;/code&gt; to execute some code which access current state of the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CHRmYU912yZDRmqz7Z490w.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;simple-script&#34;&gt;Simple script&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a break point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the Run button to execute the default node runner (ensure the debugger is enabled — &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/debugging-your-code&#34;&gt;more info&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*I-mVNLptBFDG-EaJpLR6rQ.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mocha-tests&#34;&gt;Mocha tests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/experimental-features&#34;&gt;experimental feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-8oDjYBTEU4-G8H5_vw5lg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable &amp;lsquo;Tests&amp;rdquo; from the editor settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refresh the page and see the panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put a break point in the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable debugging in the &amp;ldquo;Test&amp;rdquo; panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the test suite or scenario&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature actually worked for me, I felt just the same way when I made my first &lt;a href=&#34;http://mortalkombat.wikia.com/wiki/Animality&#34;&gt;animality in MK3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OHINaf_jcvN75EN1M0ozlQ.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;command-line-apps&#34;&gt;Command-line apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact it&amp;rsquo;s almost identical to debugging a simple script, the only detail you have to notice is an input box where you put the actual command as if ran in the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the command-line app and place a break point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Run menu to start the process in debug more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the input process name and restart the runner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*V9xHSnqzwCasqzHiHyBD5Q.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;feedback-is-nbsp-welcome&#34;&gt;Feedback is&amp;nbsp;welcome&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Cloud9 IDE</title>
      <link>https://kalinchernev.github.io/cloud9-editor/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kalinchernev.github.io/cloud9-editor/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uc-REJYHbk02nuzVQmDHHQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few months ago I attended a &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev/coding-battle-at-microsoft-innovation-center-brussels-the-rise-of-the-bots-f0887c15e257&#34;&gt;coding competition&lt;/a&gt;. In the end of the event the winners demonstrated one of their tools: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://c9.io&#34;&gt;Cloud9 editor&lt;/a&gt;. Then it hit me — I had to experiment with it! Later I used it working on various projects in my free time. Here I&amp;rsquo;m going to share my experience so far — I&amp;rsquo;m a happy user&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud9-is-nbsp-great&#34;&gt;Cloud9 is&amp;nbsp;great&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve found several key points/facts why I consider the editor to be truly astounding tool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility and User/Developer experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming&#34;&gt;Pair programming&lt;/a&gt; and education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration and open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;accessibility&#34;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool is currently &lt;a href=&#34;https://c9.io/pricing&#34;&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/c9&#34;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re not a technical person you already have reason #1 to either make a &lt;a href=&#34;https://c9.io/signup&#34;&gt;new registration&lt;/a&gt; or use your existing code-oriented account to &lt;a href=&#34;https://c9.io/login&#34;&gt;log in&lt;/a&gt; to the service. (No affiliation in the links) If you are non-technical, but very business person, you might know that &lt;a href=&#34;https://c9.io/blog/great-news/&#34;&gt;Amazon will probably grow Cloud9 in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you are a technical person and you take a closer look, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;s a charming service of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ace.c9.io/#nav=about&#34;&gt;ace&lt;/a&gt; which directly accesses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;docker&lt;/a&gt; instances. The first time I showed a working &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/create-a-workspace&#34;&gt;workspace&lt;/a&gt; to a friend developer telling him to use the environment just as Ubuntu — the response was something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DBGdHlkB6DVjBy62d3TANQ.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, he setup all his bash aliases and specific configurations and started to work with the terminal just as he&amp;rsquo;s working with his own Linux machine&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pair-programming-and-education&#34;&gt;Pair programming and education&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the environment was ready (understand having all the aliases and custom shell scripts, drush, drupal console, etc. cli tools) we went into using some of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/share-a-workspace#section-collaboration-features&#34;&gt;collaboration features&lt;/a&gt;. I will not put a meme here, but I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you this: the experience is very similar to using Google Drive for collaborating on documents in real-time, so if you like this — you&amp;rsquo;ll surely like this real-time coding experience too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming&#34;&gt;Pair programming&lt;/a&gt; on same git branch and code base is not something we usually do for various reasons, but if you like doing it, or you need to do it — I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend you Cloud9. You can pair program remotely just as you&amp;rsquo;d normally do on 1 computer: sharing terminal, files, git branches, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these pair program opportunities come also very interesting education opportunities. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs50.harvard.edu/&#34;&gt;CS50&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/start-a-nodejs-server&#34;&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;. These are good case studies of the cloud editor to encourage people of all walks of life to give programming a try and learn their &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/supported-languages&#34;&gt;preferred programming language&lt;/a&gt; without any special computer hardware requirements, i.e. they can code real applications in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;collaboration-and-open-nbsp-source&#34;&gt;Collaboration and open&amp;nbsp;source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the service is free and very fun to use, it&amp;rsquo;s naturally an optional tool when working on various projects requiring tight collaboration such as open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I decided to work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc&#34;&gt;swagger-jsdoc&lt;/a&gt; node module which I used for a small project. All I had to do to make a pull request is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a new workspace (new virtual machine in the cloud)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git clone the fork repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new branch and do your task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push back to fork repository and open a pull request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to install any software, all I had to make this contribution was to open my browser and use Cloud9 as a cloud service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;keybindings&#34;&gt;Keybindings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the items I&amp;rsquo;m using quite often and sometimes get a WOW effect from people watching me doing things like that in my browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/multiple-cursors&#34;&gt;Multiple cursors&lt;/a&gt; (yep, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sublimetext.com/&#34;&gt;sublime&lt;/a&gt; is to blame for our expectations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command line tricks work just well (Ctrl+U, Ctrl+L)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/keybindings&#34;&gt;Find in tree&lt;/a&gt; (and others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.c9.io/docs/find-and-replacing-in-files#find-in-files&#34;&gt;Search/Find&lt;/a&gt; is handy working with namespaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think normally people don&amp;rsquo;t expect a full IDE experience in the browser, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t too, and that&amp;rsquo;s the reason I mentioned Docked previously for an eye-opener. Just by the way, PHP developers might be even more surprised with things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://c9.io/blog/debug-your-php-code-with-xdebug-and-cloud9/&#34;&gt;xdebugger&lt;/a&gt; being available in their development environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-drupal-nbsp-8&#34;&gt;Setting up Drupal&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might come even more shocking for people having an idea what &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/&#34;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; is. It&amp;rsquo;s an association of heavy CMS with high resource demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, do the following the sake of having your WOW moment yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new workspace based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project&#34;&gt;Drupal Composer&lt;/a&gt; github repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the instructions to run an installation from the cli or the web (you might need to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-mysql/1718&#34;&gt;this MySQL&lt;/a&gt; article if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the idea to see your &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables&#34;&gt;environment variables&lt;/a&gt; from the command line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit from having a running Drupal 8 which uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://getcomposer.org/&#34;&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt; scripts for managing modules and dependencies to external libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I joined an event on &lt;a href=&#34;http://drupal.org&#34;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; in Hungary — the &lt;a href=&#34;http://drupalaton.hu&#34;&gt;Drupalaton&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the most exciting yearly Drupal events in Europe, organized by the local community. It gathers hundreds of contributors who collaborate on Drupal issues, share knowledge and have fun together&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this year&amp;rsquo;s event since it covered a lot of my favorite topics. (discussed shortly after) Good sessions, pleasant talks with the community, and also — a lot of new things to learn. The event took place at the shore of the biggest warm-water lake in Europe, at Lake Balaton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ME6rgg3pXT8oid14R5RNVg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sessions&#34;&gt;Sessions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, sessions were covering important &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/8&#34;&gt;Drupal 8&lt;/a&gt; features. There were several tracks, as well as sprints, where participants were able to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited mainly the workshops related to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://buytaert.net/a-roadmap-for-making-drupal-more-api-first&#34;&gt;API-first initiative&lt;/a&gt;. This is a futuristic initiative, involving many JavaScript tools and modern concepts and practices for building service-oriented apps, not only websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a vital initiative for Drupal as a platform for the future. Presently, Drupal is one of the best systems for content modelling, querying, and building websites in general. This means that normal people can make websites with complex information structures with very little or no programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API-first initiative could potentially take Drupal into a place where &lt;strong&gt;the content modelling and querying becomes data modelling and querying, enabling non-developers to build complex APIs for the next generation apps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these, there were also sessions about Drupal-specific modules being upgraded between Drupal 7 and 8. In overall, I think we&amp;rsquo;ll see more &amp;ldquo;good stuff&amp;rdquo; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://symfony.com/&#34;&gt;Symfony&lt;/a&gt;, PHP OOP, design patterns, etc topics during next Drupal events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;workshops&#34;&gt;Workshops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my humble list of highlighted sessions I focused on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2016.drupalaton.hu/schedule#speaker-166&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REST APIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Pieter Frenssen (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/u/pfrenssen&#34;&gt;pfrenssen&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4o8SJ8Q9EhrUt4fkz8DKpQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-formed, step-by-step guide, covering all important concepts of having Drupal as both server and/or a client in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.restapitutorial.com/&#34;&gt;REST API architectures&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to skip the details in this section, check &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8/rest#practical&#34;&gt;Drupal REST API docs&lt;/a&gt; which covers great amount of information around the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning was a general information about what REST actually is. This included status codes, methods, design patterns, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After presenting the basics, the next step was to use Drupal as a client, fetching data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/api&#34;&gt;drupal.org REST API&lt;/a&gt; and displaying it in a block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hechoendrupal.gitbooks.io/drupal-console/content/en/commands/generate-plugin-block.html&#34;&gt;Creating a block with Drupal Console&lt;/a&gt; was super-easy. That was a really neat way to demonstrate injecting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal.php/function/Drupal%3A%3AhttpClient/8.2.x&#34;&gt;http_client service&lt;/a&gt; via the cli from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!core.api.php/group/container/8.2.x&#34;&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a demo of using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/rest&#34;&gt;core REST API module&lt;/a&gt;, which transforms Drupal into an API server. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/restui&#34;&gt;REST UI module&lt;/a&gt; was demonstrated as a site builders&amp;rsquo; tool to manage the configurations which are otherwise &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/custom-restful-api-drupal-8&#34;&gt;managed through&amp;nbsp;.yml files&lt;/a&gt;. Here, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note, that the endpoints of the REST API are controllers. Developers have the freedom to choose which format of data to return and via which components. For example, one can use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/symfony/http-foundation&#34;&gt;Symfony&amp;rsquo;s HttpFoundation&lt;/a&gt; and its JsonResponse instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there was a lot of good advice, both about REST APIs in general, and Drupal-specific implementations, in combination with third-party tools and components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2016.drupalaton.hu/schedule#speaker-171&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headless Drupal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Ruben Teijeiro (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/u/rteijeiro&#34;&gt;rteijeiro&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I did not attend the workshop, it was still part of the Drupal API-first series of topics. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rteijeiro/headless-drupal8&#34;&gt;Code of the session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2016.drupalaton.hu/schedule#speaker-106&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive web apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Théodore Biadala (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/u/nod_&#34;&gt;nod_&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was an intermediate-level session. &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise&#34;&gt;Promises&lt;/a&gt; were in the core of all code snippets and demonstrations. Highlight APIs: &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API&#34;&gt;Fetch API&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache&#34;&gt;Cache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers&#34;&gt;Service Workers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API&#34;&gt;Web APIs&lt;/a&gt; in general. The main idea was to demonstrate how modern web APIs can be used to build web apps, having functionalities very similar to native apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theodoreb/pwa-workshop&#34;&gt;The repository&lt;/a&gt; of the workshop is public, so go and check it for further details in case you&amp;rsquo;re interested into the interface implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note the example of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theodoreb/pwa-workshop/blob/master/js/1-promise.js#L12&#34;&gt;promise-based&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/node/756722#behaviors&#34;&gt;behaviors system&lt;/a&gt;. A modernized implementation of classic concept on managing JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2016.drupalaton.hu/schedule#speaker-111&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GraphQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Sebastian Siemssen (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/u/fubhy&#34;&gt;fubhy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GraphQL?src=hash&#34;&gt;#GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; workshop w/ &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thefubhy&#34;&gt;@thefubhy&lt;/a&gt;  at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Drupalaton?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Drupalaton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/AgfQGzCq81&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/AgfQGzCq81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kalin Chernev (@kalinchernev) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kalinchernev/status/764072778773344256&#34;&gt;August 12, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, that was the &amp;ldquo;cherry&amp;rdquo; session. It was about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://graphql.org/docs/getting-started/&#34;&gt;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;, which developers were ready to understand, after touching upon REST APIs, JavaScript Frameworks, knowing what is a server and a client in general in the previous sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally enjoyed the workshop. In fact, I was even able follow along with the live coding on the main screen. It was also nice that it made a clear association between specification and language implementation. This means that same concepts of data architecture were demonstrated and practices with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql&#34;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQL&#34;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql&#34;&gt;Star Wars API&lt;/a&gt; was used with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://graphql-swapi.parseapp.com/&#34;&gt;GraphiQL&lt;/a&gt; — a hands-on tutorial to &lt;a href=&#34;http://slides.com/sebastiansiemssen/graphql-meets-drupal-dd#/3/7&#34;&gt;understand the basic concepts&lt;/a&gt; like queries, fragments, variables, sub selections, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second was the usage of node.js app with express, express-graphql, graphiql, graphql and other popular modules to transpile ES6 code. In this playground, the building part started. Various types were used: GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLString, GraphQLInt, GraphQLNonNull, GraphQLList, etc. That was my first time to actually write something working out of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://learngraphql.com/&#34;&gt;learngraphql.com&lt;/a&gt; online tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a demo of Relay in-between, as a bonus, to grab a general understanding of the additional features provided on top of the fundamental specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tpPTqCyZnfPqhb1er6ECpw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the GraphQL implementation in JavaScript was getting convenient, then we continued using the same concepts, but to build a server in PHP and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql&#34;&gt;Drupal GraphQL module&lt;/a&gt;. Sure enough, the approach was similar, but this time extending SchemaProviderBase and implementing framework-specific EntityTypeManager (&lt;a href=&#34;https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Entity%21EntityTypeManagerInterface.php/interface/EntityTypeManagerInterface/8.2.x&#34;&gt;Interface&lt;/a&gt;) to manage &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/node/2192175&#34;&gt;Content Entity&lt;/a&gt; items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was awesome, the people were great, and the sessions were truly useful. I feel somehow privileged with the opportunity to attend such a good series of sessions related to API-s in the Drupal community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of new technologies and tools to learn and play with. I hope the summary above is a good starter for anyone enthusiastic about the future of the tools mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;community&#34;&gt;Community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;End of the first day at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/drupalaton&#34;&gt;@drupalaton&lt;/a&gt; we have a great dinner. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/CN795wXixz&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/CN795wXixz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 5NET Interactive (@5NEThu) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/5NEThu/status/763818240954998789&#34;&gt;August 11, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the local Drupal community in Hungary!&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coding battle with Skygate @MolenGeek</title>
      <link>https://kalinchernev.github.io/coding-battle-molengeek/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The last event from the series of coding battles organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philos.io/&#34;&gt;Philos&lt;/a&gt;, this time in cooperation with Skygate on a life-saving topic using tools like Google Maps and Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/denisomelcenco&#34;&gt;Denis Omelcenco&lt;/a&gt; from Skygate presented the challenge: make an app to locate the closest defibrillator. The initial code base contained helpful starting materials such as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DenisSkygate/CodingBattle/blob/master/Defibrillators.json&#34;&gt;JSON file listing the defibrillators&lt;/a&gt; and their locations, together with some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DenisSkygate/CodingBattle&#34;&gt;HTML files&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate the app building. Also, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maxczet&#34;&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt; provided additional helpful resources on &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/maps/&#34;&gt;Google Maps API&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.firebase.com/&#34;&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt;, etc. As you can imagine, the topic inspired the developers since it&amp;rsquo;s based on meaningful cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of &amp;ldquo;Never too early to start&amp;rdquo;, there was a very young participant. I wish this inspires more lads and ladies to join in next events&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZiiIav-nONmY-C8LqOIxdw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-tools&#34;&gt;The tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Google Maps API&lt;/strong&gt; was the easiest for the developers, probably because it&amp;rsquo;s a popular tool many of us had used before. Needless to say, good start examples were present, together with many answers on the internet on how to handle the various topics like directions, geo-locations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firebase&lt;/strong&gt; was a new tool for my team. The tool came super-handy on building an API based on an existing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.firebase.com/docs/rest/quickstart.html&#34;&gt;JSON really really easy&lt;/a&gt;. The only step necessary was to normalize the key:value pairs to have good naming for the import. Otherwise, we built a RESTful back-end with data about defibrillators in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/swift/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was also useful tool for some who decided to build a native app&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EEgjG4Ja_L5iScKDLYM2Yg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;winners-and-working-nbsp-apps&#34;&gt;Winners and working&amp;nbsp;apps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, there were 2 working apps: the one with Swift, and one with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DenisSkygate&#34;&gt;the &amp;ldquo;starterkit&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The final presentations of the projects gave some insights on the Google Maps APIs used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A5RYiojFrUUUxRklNiRT8Q.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;time-to-enjoy-the-summer-nbsp&#34;&gt;Time to enjoy the summer&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next event will be somewhere in September, but it&amp;rsquo;s not fixed yet because of the forthcoming summer months. To get notified for the next editions, just sign in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/javascriptlab/&#34;&gt;meetup group&lt;/a&gt; or in the facebook group page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Philos we saw a growing community and interest of hacking making small useful apps in very short time. Wish them luck and more opportunities for organizing even bigger projects in the future!&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;coding-battle-at-microsoft-innovation-center-brussels-the-rise-of-the-bots&#34;&gt;Coding battle at Microsoft Innovation Center Brussels (The Rise of the Bots)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev/coding-battle-at-microsoft-innovation-center-brussels-the-rise-of-the-bots-f0887c15e257&#34;&gt;Originally published on Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on the exciting journey of coding battles and events, this time I&amp;rsquo;m so trilled on what happened that I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to put my hands back to code. So the story will be short and simple, hopefully inspiring for you to try building some cool chat bots and join me in the next coding event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;chat-bots-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot&#34;&gt;Chat Bots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, there&amp;rsquo;s been quite some noise around the topic and many companies have already jumped into it — using and developing chat bots. The benefits, as I personally feel them: &lt;em&gt;for users, chat bots are a promise for better user experience, while for developers chat bots are a promise for cool task automation and beautifully integrated event-driven apps&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, the biggest value is when a machine understands natural human communication and responds in a smart and useful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-organizers&#34;&gt;The Organizers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say this was the best coding event I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been so far. The flow was really smooth, the whole atmosphere was really good, and there were winners with a result in the end, which is a real-life app with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizing team comprised of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.carasap.be/en/&#34;&gt;CarASAP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mic-brussels.be/en/home/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Innovation Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philos.io/&#34;&gt;Philos&lt;/a&gt;. Probably because of their good collaboration, the challenge was well prepared — clear problem definition, steps to solve, examples, ongoing support during the event, and last but not least — clear end goal in mind. In short, CarASAP presented their need to automate the process of car ordering for their customers, so that they can receive service via chat. Representatives from Microsoft were going around the room answering questions, showing small steps and debugging together with us — it was really friendly environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZVk4GCCCk6zithaBa8I3-Q.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were provided with a JSON file representing the time schedule of a list of drivers. Thus, the schedule was the base information for our chat bots assisting CarASAP customers to find and order a driver. They were able to input natural sentences which the bot should understand by learning: time, date and address. (Read further to see which is the service used for understanding the natural speech&amp;nbsp;;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this event was a very good example how a business need can be solved elegantly in very short time with focused effort by a community&lt;/strong&gt;. I believe that this challenge set a good example for other companies to consider working with Philos too. Facilitating community contributions which solve real-life problems is a big thing. The way I see it, this is a Win-Win where developers learn, contribute and have fun, while business benefit resolutions and results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end of the event, there was a demonstration of the working solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7OYP5OSbEVuKgF4eIs9Xcw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credits: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/philos.io/&#34;&gt;Philos&amp;nbsp;Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tools-amp-best-practices&#34;&gt;Tools &amp;amp; Best Practices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of sharing during the event!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the developers around me I learned about &lt;a href=&#34;https://ngrok.com/&#34;&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt;, which was a handy tool to just start and run a local node.js server which is easy to integrate with other systems. It&amp;rsquo;s a time-saver when there&amp;rsquo;s no time to deploy an app to a cloud server. Deployment can be a painful part of the development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the winning team, I got inspired to research &lt;a href=&#34;https://c9.io/&#34;&gt;cloud9&lt;/a&gt; as a tool for collaborating during the next hack event, since it&amp;rsquo;s another way to save from setup and deployment procedures which can lead to errors and frustration. Also, it looks awesome to be able to pair-program in real-time with other developers directly in the editor. Research homework for me&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing API keys was another common setback for many. All I can say here is that it&amp;rsquo;s just something that has to be handled with care, because if it isn&amp;rsquo;t, it leads to mystical error codes without clear path to resolve. And a lot of time is wasted poking around debugging systems that should just work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you are not alone with these issues! Here&amp;rsquo;s a short motivational video that will make you laugh and encourage you to go forward&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFO1cRr5-qY?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For building the bots, we used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.botframework.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Bot Framework&lt;/a&gt;. I can&amp;rsquo;t explain you how amazing the APIs are! Just head directly into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.botframework.com/builder/node/overview/#navtitle&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and skim through some of the example code. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll see the easy way to start building functionalities, for which the code looks familiar to other &lt;a href=&#34;http://loopback.io/resources/#compare&#34;&gt;node.js frameworks&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from the core bot framework for managing the communication, we used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.luis.ai/&#34;&gt;LUIS&lt;/a&gt; to understand the user natural language, and process the important information from it. As a developer, I give my respect to the people who have built the framework and its documentation. It took us just few hours to figure out the APIs and make a working product!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;apis-are-really-nbsp-cool&#34;&gt;APIs are really&amp;nbsp;cool!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m generally a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer&#34;&gt;REST APIs&lt;/a&gt; and everything related to building and consuming them. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s a good architectural approach for decoupling logic and functionality to focus on solving specific problems in a re-usable way. (Yes, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://graphql.org/&#34;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; we hear about a lot recently solves some drawbacks of the design, still I think the first wave of common usage will be based on fetching data from existing REST APIs and mainly combining them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m saying is that having the opportunity to work with &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.botframework.com/builder/node/dialogs/LuisDialog/&#34;&gt;LUIS&lt;/a&gt; API is really really cool, especially in a hack event like this coding battle. Using services to solve complex problems feels good, and honestly I think this is the other topic that could be re-used many times, just like building chat bots for various purposes and business cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;That&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/API?src=hash&#34;&gt;#API&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/management?src=hash&#34;&gt;#management&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/mV5CJD84t7&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/mV5CJD84t7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amancio Bouza (@AmancioBouza) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AmancioBouza/status/738993707140190208&#34;&gt;June 4, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-community&#34;&gt;The Community&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in Brussels and following almost every initiative from Philos, I feel that the community around is getting bigger and stronger. Especially because there are opportunities to get together, learn and share! Also, this particular coding battle was an excellent example of good collaboration and focused efforts which brought real-life useful results. I speak about good collaboration between the business side of CarASAP, Microsoft Innovation Center and Philos, but also the good collaboration of developers solving challenges together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-s-next&#34;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make sure you sign up for the next coding battle — it’s the last one from the 1st edition of the HackLeague. It sounds to be really flexible on the skills necessary for the challenges, expect a lot of creativity! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HackLeague and Coding Battles were new concepts, but it’s easy to see that they are getting more traction on every step. Just looking at the number of participants increasing and the challenges getting better formulation, I firmly believe in the bright future ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also believe that HackLeague will continue to improve, as the community grows and more companies join the game. The more companies, the more interesting problems to tackle, and finally — the more knowledge sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine that with enough traction, Philos will be able to possibility develop some sort of divisions based on specific needs and markets: VR, IoT, security, algorithms, you name it. I hope these will come naturally with the upcoming partnerships and collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked the way Max presented his vision during the last event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let people learn and share with each other, the fun way. In other words: &lt;strong&gt;gamification for people creating the future&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game on coders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short retrospective on my second coding competition with JavaScript. Lessons learned and thoughts on how to improve for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.takeeateasy.be/en/&#34;&gt;Take Eat Easy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philos.io/&#34;&gt;Philos&lt;/a&gt; organized this coding competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly to &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kalin.chernev/the-first-coding-battle-in-belgium-d4f4285ffb32#.ses1gau0l&#34;&gt;the first coding battle&lt;/a&gt;, good news from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maxczet&#34;&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt; came right from the beginning: the event was part of a hack league. For developers, this means that we can hope for continuity of the coding battles: more play, plus more opportunities to interact and share with others from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jsl4b&#34;&gt;JavaScript community in Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Few other cities have benefited from similar coding competitions: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maxczet/status/725623059344986112&#34;&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maxczet/status/728555974672449536&#34;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; recently, I am looking forward to see how the wave will grow even further&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this intro, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.takeeateasy.be/en/about&#34;&gt;Jean-Christophe Libbrecht&lt;/a&gt; presented what Take Eat Easy is in simple words: delivery on time. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TakeEatEasy/hack-league&#34;&gt;The technical challenge&lt;/a&gt; was presented with focus on the same company values: optimal delivery management. I gotta say that I had a flashback to my university discipline of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research&#34;&gt;operations research&lt;/a&gt; for a minute, when thinking about routes and shortest distance. Luckily, the challenge was easier to understand than the academic subject!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall atmosphere was agréable et la majorité parlèrent en français. Positive support and guidance was coming all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting an abstract from the problem definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You play one of TEE&amp;rsquo;s bike courier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to make as much € as you can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You compete with other couriers in the city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zt3n7YspKUDLmP8Q4lN5qw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, participants had to program a courier bot, which plays with other courier bots in an imaginary city. Taking and delivering orders in an optimal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TakeEatEasy/hack-league/tree/master/node-client&#34;&gt;node client bot&lt;/a&gt; was given. I find it to be a good boilerplate for a start. Most importantly it&amp;rsquo;s clear where to include the custom logic and what are the tools to use to take actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another positive prerequisite was &lt;strong&gt;the sample state object&lt;/strong&gt;, which contained enough structure to understand the data that will be received by the client on every turn of the game. Note some important concepts are pretty obvious, I think: &lt;strong&gt;orders, possible actions and score&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/kalinchernev/d2d3e5e9ade9bca4f8ae94bc58dd5e88.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All possible actions&lt;/strong&gt; that the bots were able to play with: moving up/down/left/right, pick order, drop order. There were 2 advanced actions: upgrade fighter (be able to kick other players) and upgrade electric (move doubled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will repeat this again, I was content with the organizers. Help was kindly provided, with hints and advice all the way during the game. That made it fun to play. (No matter the fact that my team didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to get points&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*641YUOoQZYNKW5N2d4G-kw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a good &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming&#34;&gt;pair&lt;/a&gt; for the event. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Gregoirevda&#34;&gt;Gregoirevda&lt;/a&gt;) I think we got along easily and we had good time working together. Here are some highlights of the informal retrospective we did after the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Visualize the end result (expectation) before going in the code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never ran the server &amp;ldquo;city&amp;rdquo; to see how our bot moves. That was not a clear problem until the end of the competition until when we were still working on the details on how to move our courier. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep&#34;&gt;Grep&lt;/a&gt;-ing the continuously changing state object helped us get some ideas about the dynamics, but honestly it was not easy to imagine how the courier bot is actually moving on the map without the real picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to run the server (mock) locally during development just to understand and visualize the dynamics as they will be in the real game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Learn and understand the start examples and code samples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first competition I made the mistake to try to understand the logic of the core engine (server) running the game, but this time was better focusing on the sample code. Yet, I think we missed useful points and functions that we could have utilized in our favor without thinking too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the head of the function that was invoked in every turn of the game contained the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34;&gt;// Fetch my courier and possible order from the state  
var state = data.state;  
var possibleActions = data.possibleActions;  
var myCourier;  
var myOrder;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And guess what? That was prepared for us before-hand so that we could use these variables &amp;ldquo;as-is&amp;rdquo;. I have to say, I was mixing the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; variables pretty much, but that&amp;rsquo;s another topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of the code contained this line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34;&gt;// Sample response.
respond(getDirection(data.possibleActions,myCourier.position,{x:1,y:2}));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getDirection()&lt;/code&gt; returns the best move depending on the current position and possible actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;respond()&lt;/code&gt; is the function to invoke in order to take actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;respond()&lt;/code&gt; took us away, because we decided to focus on the actions, and somehow it was pretty late in the game when we figured the getDirection() function for possible re-use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Strategy and task separation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most complex part of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we didn&amp;rsquo;t have clear strategy while developing the bot, it surely would have helped. For example, we started implementing functions for the bonus skills like having an electric bike and kicking other players before deciding how to move and take orders&amp;nbsp;:D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But seriously, possible strategy for this challenge could probably be to separate the approach in 2: functions for working with distance, and such for working with actions. Though we didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to have a complete combination of actions based on distance and value, we spoke about the fact that we were not clear about the order of combined actions we need to take. We took a delivery and then we were just standing at a place, since the next step was not foreseen. However, we prepared to be able to kick other players just standing there with our delivery in our hands! (we never got the points for the advanced action of kicking)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that breaking down a challenge into small tasks plays an important role in problem solving, especially in short-time hack event. Also, event handling actions with state management seem to be recurring patterns, so it&amp;rsquo;s worth getting some more practice there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;coming-up&#34;&gt;Coming up&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many developers don&amp;rsquo;t go to competitions because they believe they are not good enough with JavaScript or they will not perform well in hack events under stress. Even though there is positive stress, with this retrospective and code samples I hope that I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to demonstrate that the challenge itself was doable and fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/coding-battle-microsoft-innovation-center-brussels-carasap-tickets-25839985091&#34;&gt;next coding battle will be at Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and the event is open for registrations. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you to grab the opportunity to broaden your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, consider inviting your colleagues to join you too. As you can imagine, the short hacking time will naturally give you ideas on how to communicate effectively with your colleagues when you work together in different environment. Also, you will see new ways to break down tasks and problem solve by observing and sharing with other developers you meet at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-do-you-nbsp-think&#34;&gt;What do you&amp;nbsp;think?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really interested to hear feedback on my thoughts and ideas about the code and the highlights. Maybe you have a different point of view? Share it in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The first coding battle in Belgium</title>
      <link>https://kalinchernev.github.io/first-coding-battle-belgium/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coding-battle-what&#34;&gt;Coding? Battle? What?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, coding is an act of expressing ways of thinking and problem-solving skills. However, in reality, it&amp;rsquo;s a more than that. It&amp;rsquo;s a proof of understanding complex concepts, and creating useful solutions with this understanding. Also, in fact, coding is frequently an act of showing narrow knowledge of a specific framework or knowledge of an API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battles, on the other hand, are not an every-day thing. Rap battles and games are fun though, why not take the same experience into another subject matter as an expression of quick-thinking and winning attitude?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining those, one can already enjoy online platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://codefights.com/&#34;&gt;codefights.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens in offline, face-to-face world though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;coding-battle&#34;&gt;Coding battle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to get experience actively. Battling is not only about watching a presentation, but solving problems. Quickly. And effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into a battle is a learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-organizers&#34;&gt;The organizers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philos.io/&#34;&gt;Philos Lab&lt;/a&gt; is a frequent organizer of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/javascriptlab/&#34;&gt;JavaScript events&lt;/a&gt; around Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.woorank.com/&#34;&gt;Woorank&lt;/a&gt; is a product-oriented company who kindly prepared the challenges and hosted the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, they organized the first coding battle in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-battle&#34;&gt;The battle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was more enjoyable than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I was doubtful about my own skills and readiness to go into a competition. That&amp;rsquo;s because JavaScript is changing every day, learning fatigue is something normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this competition, developers had to program a bot, playing against a dealer bot based on this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Woorank/blackjack-challenge&#34;&gt;blackjack challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The rules were simple, there were teams (4 rounds by 4), playing against each other on playoffs principle. The better ratio of games won vs games lost ruled winning teams to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I enjoyed the challenge. It didn&amp;rsquo;t require any previous knowledge of frameworks like Angular or React, but rather assumed general knowledge: variables, scope, functions and loops. That was really important in terms of facilitating the teams to focus on strategic thinking programming their automated bots, rather frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe these characteristics of the challenge were truly important. In the end, it was not really about whether or not developers know JavaScript or frameworks deeply, but rather: can developers understand requirements, code and logic quickly (2 hours and 30 minutes :), and provide solutions based on mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-did-i-nbsp-learn&#34;&gt;What did I&amp;nbsp;learn&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Re-consider understanding the core algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of 2 hours and 30 minutes, I spent maybe around 40 minutes trying to figure out the structure of the code of the &amp;ldquo;dealer&amp;rdquo;. (the server) That might have been useful if I knew specifically that my results/winning will be evaluated based on understanding other people&amp;rsquo;s code. That&amp;rsquo;s not impossible, but takes a lot of time! Take-away: listen carefully for the expectations. Reading and understanding API-s as-is is not helping in a battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s useful to know the subject matter of the challenge, i.e. blackjack. Though every challenge will be different, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t focus on this in my next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Focus on super-clear communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens every day, it happens in battles as well — discussing scope, persistence and making use of history of actions for future actions. There is no place for bad communication in a battle. Global scope is so much not an object scope. And dependency injection is not always possible, don&amp;rsquo;t take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Focus on mathematics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I don&amp;rsquo;t take myself as an expert in algorithms, making mathematical model of if-else-s is important. Me and my team-mate did not have any idea what a blackjack is, but we googled for strategies we translated into mathematics we implemented: and we ended up in the finals. You really have to experience this to believe it: creating code with clear mathematics that solves problems for you is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Team-work is important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to go too deep into this. I was lucky with this one during the particular event. I worked together with a colleague I work with every day&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splitting down the small details was a breeze: which functions should do what, why, how, etc. The action was so hot that at some point using the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of&#34;&gt;for of&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; syntax fit perfectly for the general foreach() equivalent for the major chunk for the decider logic. Believe me, there is no time to re-factor, questions like sugar in JS: Class vs Function, public method of a module vs private method of an instance are too tiny of topics in dynamic circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kalinchernev.github.io/images/coding-battle-code.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Team work during coding event&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;community&#34;&gt;Community&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In overall, the big winning was absolutely going into the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kalinchernev.github.io/images/coding-battle-community.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Community&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good-bye picture at the spacious Woorank&amp;nbsp;office&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;bragging-time&#34;&gt;Bragging time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this competition, my team reached the finals, team-6&amp;nbsp;;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kalinchernev.github.io/images/coding-battle-table.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Blackjack table&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;table&amp;rdquo; server where bots (teams) play against a dealer&amp;nbsp;(bot)&lt;/p&gt;
