Recently, I came across the website of Eclipse Che, naturally spinning an instance
on [Codenvy](https://codenvy.com) few minutes later. Codenvy seems to be highly
impressive solution alternative to a similar IDE I sometimes use - Cloud 9.

In this article, I'll demonstrate some of my favorite features of the platform,
read further if:

- you are a developer interested into using containers in your development environment
- you are a developer working on Vagrant or similar VM looking for a way to switch to a containers
development environment
- you have already worked with Cloud9 Editor and are open to learn alternatives
- you are a teacher who wants to teach programming in the browser
- you want to quickly contribute to open source
- you want to develop cloud applications easily
