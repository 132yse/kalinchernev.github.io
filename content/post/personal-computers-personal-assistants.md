- personal assistant
-- banking for savings
-- help from google for calculating your route to home, traffic issues


- no-chat chat bot - like the TC, similar to a call center with pre-defined answers
- problems with expectations - too much is expected from the bots

In FB
- cannot find the right bot to chat with (i.e. Uber actually human)
- page vs bot similarity or distinction

--- POSSIBLE GOOD IMPLICATIONS ---

Bots will kill not-yet-automated low value human interactions
- automating pizza ordering (many customers order the same type of pizza on the same address)
- custom support for basic questions (basically identifying what the custom is asking for and if the
  question is actually basic)
- triaging issues (can this be traslated to github issue queue triaging?)
- FAQ - same/similar questions being answered

Bot could also be a replacement for the sms - KLM sending you a notification via
the fb messanger rather than the sms (links to boarding pass, etc.)

Bots in slack channels / corporate chats
- taking holidays
- following boring company rules (governments?)

Political automated discussions with communities.
- twitter accounts which manage the PR of popular accounts/Donald Trump/

Smart speakers
- alexa and google home

Mobile-only / Bots-only / Vocal-only?
=> all that makes sense for the user

FB/Google and big player already have apps on the user devices
- > better coverage instead of installing new apps
