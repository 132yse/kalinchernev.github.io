## Going Serverless

[Serverless computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) is a relatively new trend which is getting greater popularity after Amazon released their [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) service in the end of 2014. I published about this topic in a bit [more details earlier this year](https://kalinchernev.github.io/january-digest-2017/#cloud). In one sentence, serverless architectures (aka cloud functions) are getting traction in cases where high-level architecture control is sufficient for developers who delegate the details about the infrastructure management to a hidden underlying layer managed by a cloud provider.
